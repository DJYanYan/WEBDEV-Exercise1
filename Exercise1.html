    <h1>Trip to Mindanao</h1>
    <p>Documenting my latest trip to Mindanao</p>

    <h2>January 8, 2022</h2>

    <p>
      This is Ragga Ragga Beach Located in <em>Barobo, Surigao Del Sur</em>.
    </p>
    <p>We passed through different cities to get to here:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Butuan City</li>
      <li>Bayugan City</li>
      <li>Prosperidad</li>
      <li>Lianga</li>
      <li>Barobo</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>January 22, 2022</h2>
    <p>
      We went to a museum resort name The Balanghai Hotel and they had a sign
      saying:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      Heritage of the past <br />is the seed that <br />brings forth the
      <br />harvest of the future
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Since it was a museum it was full of antiques and rich in history. It was
      a fun trip.
    </p>

    <h2>February 11, 2022</h2>

    <img src="forest.jpg" alt="Abaca Farm" style="width: 30%" />

    <p>
      This is our friend's Abaca Farm located near Bukidnon. We made sure to
      pack all the equipment necessary for a hike;
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Water</li>
      <li>Hats and Caps</li>
      <li>Trekking Pole</li>
      <li>Food</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Just the essentials. It didn't take too long to tour the entire farm.</p>
